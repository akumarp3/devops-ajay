Q. What are environment variables and PATH variables?
A. Environment Variables: They hold values related to current environment like Operating system or user sessions.
   Path:  It specifies the directories in which executable programs* are located on the machine that can be started without knowing and typing the whole path to the file on the command line.

Q. How do we set environment variables and assign them a PATH?
A. To create environment variables: export <var_name>=<path_of_executable files>
		$ env (gives list of all environment variables)
   Assigning PATH(using complete path): export PATH=$PATH:<path> (EX: export PATH=$PATH:/home/mra/Desktop/dir/)
   Assigning PATH(using Environment Variables): export PATH=$PATH:${<ENV_VAR_NAME>}/bin
		$ echo $PATH (gives list of all PATH's set)
